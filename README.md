# DRAGONCandidates
This repository serves as the public data release for all of the DRAGON candidates. For details on the model, please go to the [DRAGON_CNN](https://github.com/iam37/DRAGON_CNN/tree/main) repository. 

We intend for the DRAGON Dual AGN candidates to be an unstructured *public collaboration*. We have made all of the data on these candidates
(RA, Dec, J2000 objID, and even preliminary redshifts) available to be claimed. 

# Contributing
To claim and analyze a candidate, you must do the following:
1) Open up an *Issue*. This Issue Template is prefilled with placeholders that you will have to fill in: your name, and the candidate ID.
2) One of us will *approve* your claim, in which case it will be publicly displayed on `CLAIMS.md`.
3) After analysis is complete, add your candidate and its data to the CSV file, and indicate whether it is a true dual AGN.
4) Submit a *pull request*. This pull request is also prefilled like the Issue Request with placeholders.
5) One of us will *approve* the pull request, and your data will be merged into the final CSV.

Once a candidate is claimed, we expect that no one else will attempt to analyze the same candidate. If more than
two teams wish to claim the same candidate, we will include both data in the CSV.
